The objective of this project is to propose a methodology for the automatic classification of skin lesions, based on image analysis and machine learning.

# 1 - Database

The database is composed of 200 original images of pigmented skin lesions acquired by
dermoscopy. 100 of them have been histopathologically confirmed as melanomas. Thus two
classes are considered in this project: on the one hand confirmed melanomas and on the
other hand the remaining benign lesions.
In addition to the original images, binary images representing the region of interest of
each lesion are included in the database. The segmentation of the images using superpixels
are also added.
